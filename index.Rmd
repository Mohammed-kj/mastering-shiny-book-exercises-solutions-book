# Welcome {-}

<img src="img/mastering-shiny-cover.png" class="cover" width="250" height="328"/>This is the website for Mastering Shiny Solutions, a solutions manual for the exercises in [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/), written by Hadley Wickham. 

[Mastering Shiny Solutions 2021](https://mastering-shiny-solutions.org/), by Maya Gans and Marly Gotti, was released in early 2021. Since then, there have been various changes to the exercises in Mastering Shiny, and this book serves as an _updated version_. A few solutions in this book defer to those provided in Mastering Shiny Solutions 2021. Also, some exercises don't contain solutions, and for these exercises, the author writes, "Not sure".
