# Welcome {-}

<img src="img/mastering-shiny-cover.png" class="cover" width="250" height="328"/>This is the WIP website for Mastering Shiny Solutions, a solution manual to the exercises in [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/), written by Hadley Wickham. 

The solutions are entirely worked out by [Howard Baek](http://insidethetv.rbind.io/).
